## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds Rolles, a new smith in Waukeen's Promenade above the entrance to Adventurer Mart, who can upgrade items. He also sells a few scrolls and items.

Please see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpellholdStudios/Rolles/master/rolles/readme/rolles-readme-english.txt">rolles-readme-english.txt</a> for details.


<hr>


## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

#### Games supported

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/36655-rolles">report them on the forum!</a><br>

## 

#### Installation Order

>Although it is not required for the Rolles mod to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install Rolles after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack, and EET.
- Please install Rolles before EET_End, and any final "biffing" routines.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-rolles.exe`__, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: __rolles__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Rolles for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: rolles folder and a setup-rolles.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-rolles.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-rolles.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Mac OS

Rolles for Mac OS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: rolles folder, setup-rolles and setup-rolles.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-rolles.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-rolles.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Rolles for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-rolles`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-rolles --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.<br>

Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the override folder.

	- Replaced `AUTHOR` keyword with `SUPPORT`.
	- Added `VERSION` flag.
	- Commented code as much as possible.
